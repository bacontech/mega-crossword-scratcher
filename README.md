# mega-crossword-scratcher

Made an app to help solve the Mega Crossword Scratch Lottery ticket here in Nebraska.  I was gifted a few dozen and was nervous that I was leaving money on the table.  And it was an excuse to hack away at something.

There are two main sections on the lottery ticket that this app cares about.


`Your Letters` and the puzzles (there are 3).

You type in your letters, and then type in the words found in the puzzles, and this app will tell you have many "good word" matches are found.
